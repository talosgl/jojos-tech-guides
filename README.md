# Jojo's Tech Guides
Practical development environment and workflow guides. We try very hard not to make assumptions about what you already know.

## Setup Guides
- **[Get Set Up to Install and Run Python Scripts on Your Computer](docs/python/script-setup.md)** - Get from "I found a Python script" to "it's running on my computer" with a clean, sustainable setup.
- **[Manage private and public GitHub repos from a single local git repository](docs/git/one-git-repo-two-remotes.md)** - Use two different GitHub repositories mapped to a single local repository directory.
- **[How to Annotate Code Without Modifying Source Files](docs/dev-workflow/line-note-junction.md)** - Take notes on source codebases where you cannot easily or safely modify and add traditional code comments.

## Coming Soon
